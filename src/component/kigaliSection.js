        You may have your opinions about Kigali â€” or maybe you don't. We understand. While the world has been busy not thinking about us, we've been quietly stacking up new accolades, accomplishments, and experiences. Year after year, list after list, people are starting to see the greatness we've always known was here. Now is the time we stop keeping it to ourselves.

      A city reborn from its past, a beacon of innovation and progress in Africa, a culinary scene bursting with flavor, art and culture that tell stories of resilience and hope, and so much more.
